# Milestone 2

For Milestone 2, the acceptance criteria required the evidence to:
1.	demonstrate the capability to pass data/datum from an EVM chain to Cardano; and
2.	show that the data/datum on both chains match.

<ins>Evidence 1a: https://testnet.wanscan.org/tx/0xb0fb9ff5a31122d0de385a799cf7dccab35a5a3bfbdc524df762727de2e99fc9?cc=false</ins>
-	This is the on-chain transaction record for a WAN to ADA cross-chain swap. WAN is an asset on the Wanchain L1 Blockchain, an EVM-compatible blockchain. ADA is an asset on Cardano.
-	This transaction proves that the capability to pass specific data/datum from an EVM chain to Cardano has been achieved. 
-	This transaction was initiated on the Wanchain L1 Blockchain (an EVM-compatible blockchain) and indicates that WAN has been transferred to Cardano and that some specific data/datum was emitted. This proves that data/datum was emitted on the EVM chain. Note that this data/datum includes the sending address (07b2e0a113fD1E3ca765C217F5c4efA28d22eeDF) and that the transaction’s hash is b0fb9ff5a31122d0de385a799cf7dccab35a5a3bfbdc524df762727de2e99fc9.
-	A screenshot of the input data is included below, for convenience.

<ins>Evidence 1b: https://preprod.cexplorer.io/tx/37dd8eca74bd572ec744ab38753b34c8ebb539197530057080e0ce9b5159eac2/</ins> 
-	This is the corresponding on-chain transaction record on Cardano. This confirms that WAN has been minted on Cardano and proves that the data/datum was received on Cardano.

<ins>Evidence 2: https://preprod.cexplorer.io/datum/5f257bf0c3e12fa46d71de4817aec6975b7c4bda263c74aa681dd4216c57a342</ins>
-	This is the data/datum detail on Cardano. Note that this data/datum also includes the sending address (07b2e0a113fD1E3ca765C217F5c4efA28d22eeDF) and that original transaction’s hash (b0fb9ff5a31122d0de385a799cf7dccab35a5a3bfbdc524df762727de2e99fc9). This shows that the data/datum on both the EVM chain and Cardano match.
